# UrbanSoundClassification
Urban sound classification model using Convolutional neural networks

The Urban Sound dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.
In this project, a deep learning model is built to classify the audio clips to the 10 different classes.
